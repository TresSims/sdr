There are two versions of Houdini Docker images:
    One is on Windows system, and the other is on Ubuntu system.
    Ubuntu version is recommended, because the image size is much smaller.


Prerequisite:
1. You should have Docker and Docker-compose installed if you're on Linux
   host; You should have Docker Desktop installed if you're on Windows/Mac host.
2. Since Houdini18.5, the installer argument `accept-EULA` requires an EULA
   Last Updated Date to be passed in.
   E.g. Current EULA was updated on 2020-05-05, so you should modify "UPDATE_ME"
        in the Dockerfile to be "2020-05-05" if you would like to use H18.5+;
        You should delete "UPDATE_ME" for H18.0 and previous versions.


To set up anyone version of Houdini Docker image:
1. Download the corresponding version Houdini from sidefx.com
   E.g. If you'd prefer to use Linux version of Houdini Docker image, you should
        download Linux version Houdini.
2. Put the Houdini installer to "Ubuntu" or "Windows" folder accordingly.
3. Check if the "UPDATE_ME" keyword in Dockerfile is modified correctly.
4. Navigate to the folder and run command `docker-compose build`


Some handy docker-compose commands:
1. `docker-compose run -d -p 1715:1715 sesinetd` if youâ€™d like to create your 
   own sesinetd License Server
2. `docker-compose run hython` to start up the interactive terminal with
    hython container. 
    For Linux version container, hython is in /opt/hfs[VERSION] folder;
    For Windows version container, hython is in 
        C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini[VERSION] folder.
3. `docker-compose build` to build/rebuild the Houdini Docker images.


Some notes about Docker:
1. Docker requires Windows image version to match host's OS version.
   Current Windows Houdini image is based on windows:1903, you might
   need to update that accordingly.
2. Mac and Windows version Docker doesn't support "host" network, but host
   is reachable on the special DNS name "host.docker.internal".
   If you have a running "sesinetd" License Server on host and would like to
   connect to it for license checkout, you could switch hserver's connected 
   server to it.
3. All platforms (Mac/Linux/Windows) support Linux version Houdini image.
   Only Windows host supports Windows Houdini image. 
4. Don't forget to toggle which daemon (Linux or Windows) the Docker CLI 
   talks to if you are using Windows Docker Desktop. 
   You could switch it from the Docker Desktop menu: 
       "Switch to Windows containers to use Windows containers" and 
       "Switch to Linux containers to use Linux containers"
